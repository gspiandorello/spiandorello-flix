# Spiandorello Flix

Welcome to Spiandorello Flix, a personal project developed to deepen my knowledge of React and web development. This web application is inspired by video streaming services but focuses on presenting films currently in theaters. It provides a platform for users to explore the latest movie offerings, favorite them for easy access, and delve into detailed information about each film, such as ratings and summaries. Moreover, users can view movie trailers directly on YouTube, enhancing the movie selection experience. Please note that the application does not offer movie watching capabilities.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the components and pages, ensuring a visually appealing layout.
- **External APIs**: For fetching real-time data about the current movies in theaters, including details like ratings and trailers.

## Installation and Setup

Setting up Spiandorello Flix on your local machine is straightforward:

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. In a terminal, navigate to the project directory and execute `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. After the installation, start the application by running `npm start`. It will automatically open in your default web browser, ready for you to explore.
